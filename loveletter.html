    Thank you.
    <br><br>
    I know thank you is quite random to say but it’s true, I’m filled with so much gratitude.
I am forever grateful I met you this year. 
I told God at the beginning of this year that I want to do things I’ve been too scared to do. I told God I wanted to go to places I wouldn’t have tried to go on my own accord. I didn’t have a plan and honestly didn’t think it would actually fall through. Then I met Somebi and Friends and it felt like a whole new world and in that new, beautiful world, I had the pleasure of meeting you. From being an admirer of your work before I even knew it was you to acquaintances, then friends to being partners(like huh????)
    <br><br>
    When I had the pleasure of speaking to you, you were so polite and sweet. You were talking to Nayd and I just standing off to the side and you waved and said Hi and I remember saying it back and just staring at you. Your eyes were really big and my mind literally compared them to Boba. I smiled, I felt included. You have this presence that makes people feel safe to be themselves and that’s one of the many things I adore about you. Sometimes I worry about being too much, doing too little and I overthink things I know I shouldn’t but I can’t help it, you are literally YOU.
    <br><br>
    And I’m not saying this because you are my boyfriend, I’m saying this because I know you as a person. A person who isn’t afraid to feel. A person who loves to question, investigate, discover. A person who loves his family. A person who is unapologetic about the things they love. A person who holds a lens and captures every single moment, freezing them in time so that he may never forget. A person with such a beautiful smile and laugh that instantly makes me grin. A person with eyes so big and bright. A person who gets shit done. A person knows he is the SHIT. A person who I love listening to. A person who continuously wants to keep going and get better. A person who is so smart that it hurts when I see him doubt himself or question his capability. A person who I’m blessed enough to call mine and love wholeheartedly. A person who loves his Creator and makes a continuous effort to build a relationship with Him.
    <br><br>
    Sometimes I wonder whether I’m too boring, I’m not very interesting, so sometimes I wonder how you feel just staying around me for a long period of time. I kid you not, I genuinely couldn’t fathom the thought of you liking me. When Nayd used to hint it, I was like, “not possible” and now I’ve gotten to know you, you’re weird as shit and i absolutely adore it. I absentmindedly attached certain characters to you, I don’t know why I used to kinda put others on a pedestal and thought everyone was above me when that’s not the case at all. I am just as important as the next person and I’m glad I figured that out.
    <br><br>
    I’m not giving you credit but I’m thanking you for pushing me to chasing things I only wrote about in a notebook. Thank you for including me in your work, you don’t know how happy it made me that I was able to help with Price of Fame. Thank you for listening to be complain. Thanks for watching me embarrass myself on a daily basis. Thanks for being patient with me and making sure I understand things instead of making fun of me. Thanks for letting me steal your clothes. Thanks for always walking me back to hostel even though I hate when you don’t let me walk you. Thank you for always just being there. Thank you.
    <br><br>
    What I’m mainly trying to say is that I’m very happy I got to spend majority of my 2025 with you. Heading into 2026, I want us to lead with Christ, love, peace, discipline, passion and confidence in our relationship, academics, friendships, work and spiritual life. 
<br><br>
Always know, I am never NOT rooting for you. Whenever I get an opportunity to, I show people your work. I’m super proud of you. Everything you’re working on has so much passion and dedication written all over it and I know how people like me who would appreciate a third space and Jupe’s loft is what we need, a cafe with studio spaces. A playground for the creative scene. A hub for collaboration and creativity. I pray and pray that God will let everything fall into place, even if it’s not in the way you expect. 
<br><br>
In 2026, all I want is for you to make more memories and help one another grow. Obviously I want so much for us! Like our one year milestone, dates here and there, you meeting my parents and so much more but my main priority is being there for you, helping you where I can, praying for you and supporting you always. I want to take pictures, make fake vlogs, post content together on TikTok, have random play fights, sing white girl music in rockstar voices, run together in the mornings, go to new places, try new things. To simply put it, I just want to be around you and always appreciate your presence, I never want to take such a pretty soul like you for granted, ever. You deserve so much and if I give you something, I will.
<br><br>
Gosh that was so intimate, I’m still a hard guy sha.
<br><br>
I love you.
<br><br>
xoxo
